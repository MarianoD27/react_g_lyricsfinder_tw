use axios .get(url...).then(res => etc etc)

here I put the search comp in a different comp so we'll have to send the lyrics back to the parent:


in Appjs (parent):
create the useState for parent's lyricsP and errorP
create fn:
fn handleLyricsFC(l){setLyricsP(l)}
fn handleErrorFC(e){setErrorP(e)}
* then when we use <Search/> we add as a prop: sendLyrics = {handleLyricsFC}  
sendError = {handleErrorFC}
//these being the functions above that will be executed to set our parent's value


in Searchjs (child):
from the get go set as a prop in the main function the name of the props we disposed before, here:
{sendLyrics, sendError}
now with useEffect second parameter of errorMsg and lyrics. so that it executes when that change we put the props and pass the values in the function:
sendLyrics(lyrics)
sendError(errorMsg)


EXTRA: to display lyrics wrap it in a <pre>, it looks like native from where it came
